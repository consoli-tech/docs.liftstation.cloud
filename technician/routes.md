## Overview

The routes screen displays the routes you have access to. Routes are also color coded,
so you can check if they have been completed.

## Offline Mode

If an internet connection is not available, or if there is a problem with the server the
app will go into offline mode. Route buttons will appear gray; the status indicator to the
right of 'Your Routes' will say 'You are offline'.
